# Portfolio — Bootcamp Fullstack Developer Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises completed during a Fullstack Developer bootcamp. The material is organized into sections that reflect the course structure: a personal portfolio, module challenges, visual/asset resources, and small interactive demos. This README describes each section's purpose and how to use or run the examples — it does not list individual files.

**Repository Sections (what they are)**
- **Portfolio**: A personal portfolio site demonstrating layout, component sections, and visual presentation. Intended to showcase multiple project highlights and personal information.
- **Module Challenges**: Short exercises and challenge projects that practice specific front-end skills such as layout, CSS selectors, animation, and small DOM interactions. Each challenge focuses on a single topic or UI pattern.
- **Assets & Media**: Image and asset folders used by the portfolio and the challenges (icons, photos, and other static resources). These support visuals and are referenced from the example pages.
- **Interactive Demos**: Small pages that include JavaScript for interactivity (for example, a To‑Do list demo or simple controls). These illustrate basic client-side logic and event handling.

**How to view the examples**
- Quick view: Open an example page by double-clicking the page's `index.html` in your file manager — this opens it in your default browser.
- Recommended for development: Open the repository or a module folder in Visual Studio Code and use the Live Server extension to get live reload while you edit files.
- Local static server (PowerShell + Python):

```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\ToonA\WIT-FullStackDeveloper-Bootcamp'
python -m http.server 8000; # then open http://localhost:8000
```

**What each section contains (detailed descriptions)**
- Portfolio: contains the full-page layout and styles for a personal site, including hero/header, about, project highlights, and contact sections. The portfolio demonstrates responsive layout techniques, typography choices, and basic navigation.
- Module Challenges: each module focuses on a single concept (for example, CSS selectors, responsive layout, or component composition). The challenges are intended as focused practice: read the page to see the interaction or visual being demonstrated.
- Assets & Media: image collections and related static files used to style pages and illustrate content. These are kept separate to make it easy to swap resources or update visuals without changing page code.
- Interactive Demos: small, self-contained pages showing JavaScript-driven behaviors (adding/removing items, simple animations, button interactions). These are useful starting points for learning DOM APIs and event handling.

**Development tips and troubleshooting**
- If images do not appear, check that the browser can access the referenced asset paths. Paths are typically relative to the example page.
- Open the browser Developer Tools (F12) to inspect console errors and network requests when a page behaves unexpectedly.
- When editing styles or scripts, use Live Server or a local static server to avoid restrictions some browsers impose on file:// requests.

**Owner / contribution**
- Owner: the bootcamp student who created these examples. Contributions or suggestions are welcome — if you want improvements for a specific section (for example, responsive fixes or accessibility improvements), tell me which section and I will help.

**License**
- No license is included by default. If you would like an open-source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.), tell me which license to add and I will create a `LICENSE` file.

**Next steps I can help with**
- Create a short bilingual README (English + Thai).
- Add a `LICENSE` file (suggest `MIT` for permissive reuse).
- Run a specific example with Live Server and check console warnings.
- Improve responsive styling or accessibility for any page — tell me the section name.

Please tell me which next action you prefer, or which section you want improved first.
